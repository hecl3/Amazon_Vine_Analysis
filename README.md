# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

**Overview of the analysis:**

Here we took a dataset of certain product reviews on Amazon, in this case video game reviews, and looked at the comparison between Vine and non Vine reviews.

**Results:**

**How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?**

Here we see that there were 48 5 Star reviews through Vine, or 51.06%. By contrast, there were 15,663 non Vine reviews, or about 38.7%.

**Summary:**

In summary, I think it's very clear that there is a positivity bias within the Vine program. There's an almost 13% increase in amount of positive reviews even though there's a significantly smaller portion of reviews. Of the 15,711 positive reviews, only 48 were from the Vine program, but over half of the Vine reveiws were 5 stars, compared to the 38.7% of the non Vine reviews that made up the 5 stars.
